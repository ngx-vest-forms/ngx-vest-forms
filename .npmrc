# Required because Storybook 10.0.8 and jest-preset-angular 15.0.3 don't support Angular 21 yet
# Storybook angular peer deps: ">=18.0.0 < 21.0.0"
# jest-preset-angular peer deps: ">=18.0.0 <21.0.0"
# Remove this when upgrading to Storybook 11+ or jest-preset-angular 16+
#
# NOTE: npm 11.6.1 has a bug where `npm ci` fails with legacy-peer-deps
# Workaround: Use `npm install` locally, or downgrade to npm 10.x
# Tracking: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/7974
