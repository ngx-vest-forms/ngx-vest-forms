feat(validation-config): add fluent builder API with type safety and comprehensive documentation

## What Changed

### New Features
- Add ValidationConfigBuilder class with fluent API for creating validation configurations
- Add createValidationConfig<T>() factory function for type-safe builder instantiation
- Add duplicate detection warnings in development mode for both whenChanged() and bidirectional()
- Add comprehensive test suite with 46 tests covering all builder methods and edge cases

### Builder Methods
- whenChanged(trigger, dependents): One-way dependency (country → state/zipCode)
- bidirectional(field1, field2): Two-way dependency (password ↔ confirmPassword)
- group(fields): All fields revalidate each other (N×N-1 dependencies)
- merge(config): Combine with existing configurations

### Documentation
- Add dedicated ValidationConfig Builder API section in README.md (132 lines)
- Add comprehensive VALIDATION-CONFIG-BUILDER.md guide (843 lines)
  - Why ValidationConfig Matters (explains stale validation problem with omitWhen/skipWhen)
  - Complete API Reference with "When to Use", "Real-World Use Case", and "Vest.js Patterns"
  - Common Patterns (password confirmation, date ranges, address validation, etc.)
  - Migration Guide (manual → builder conversion)
  - Best Practices and Performance Considerations
  - Troubleshooting section
- Update ngx-vest-forms.instructions.md to feature builder as recommended approach
- Update utilities reference table with createValidationConfig() link

### Real-World Usage
- Refactor purchase-form.component.ts to use builder API
  - Reduced from 28 lines of manual config to 16 lines with builder
  - Use computed signal with conditional builder methods based on form state
  - Clear, self-documenting code showing practical usage

### Exports
- Export ValidationConfigBuilder and createValidationConfig from public-api.ts

## Why This Matters

### Problem Solved
Manual validation configuration is verbose, error-prone, and lacks type safety:
- Easy to forget reverse dependencies (password → confirmPassword, but not the reverse)
- No IDE autocomplete for field names
- No compile-time type checking
- Intent is unclear from raw object syntax

### Builder Benefits
- ✅ Full IDE autocomplete for all field paths
- ✅ Compile-time type checking (catches typos before runtime)
- ✅ Self-documenting code (intent clear from method names)
- ✅ Less boilerplate (bidirectional() handles both directions)
- ✅ Development-mode warnings for duplicate dependencies
- ✅ Zero production overhead (ngDevMode checks)

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
- Uses FieldPath<T> for full type safety on all field references
- Works seamlessly with DeepPartial<T> form models
- IDE autocomplete includes nested paths (e.g., 'addresses.billing.street')

### Duplicate Detection
- Development-mode warnings for duplicate dependents in whenChanged()
- Development-mode warnings for duplicate bidirectional relationships
- Automatic deduplication even when duplicates are detected
- Zero runtime overhead in production (ngDevMode checks)

### Testing
- 46 comprehensive tests covering all methods and edge cases
- Tests for whenChanged(), bidirectional(), group(), merge(), build()
- Duplicate detection warning tests (dev mode vs production)
- Complex scenario tests with real-world examples
- Type safety verification tests

### Performance
- build() returns deep copy (immutable)
- Deduplication using Set for O(n) performance
- group() creates N×(N-1) dependencies (documented performance note)
- Builder reusable after build() calls

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a new feature that doesn't affect existing code.

## Migration Path
Existing manual configurations continue to work. Users can gradually migrate:

Before (manual):
```typescript
protected readonly validationConfig = {
  'password': ['confirmPassword'],
  'confirmPassword': ['password'],
  'country': ['state', 'zipCode'],
};
```

After (builder):
```typescript
protected readonly validationConfig = createValidationConfig<FormModel>()
  .bidirectional('password', 'confirmPassword')
  .whenChanged('country', ['state', 'zipCode'])
  .build();
```

## Documentation Coverage
- README.md: Quick introduction with examples and benefits
- VALIDATION-CONFIG-BUILDER.md: Comprehensive 843-line guide
- ngx-vest-forms.instructions.md: Featured as recommended approach
- purchase-form.component.ts: Real-world working example
- JSDoc: Extensive method documentation with examples

## Testing
✅ All 46 tests pass (100% success rate)
✅ Duplicate warnings correctly appear in dev mode only
✅ Type safety verified at compile time
✅ Edge cases covered (empty arrays, single-field groups, chaining after build)
