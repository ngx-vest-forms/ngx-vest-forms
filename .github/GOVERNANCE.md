# Repository Governance

This document outlines the governance model and repository rules for the ngx-vest-forms project.

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Model

### Repository Structure

- **Main Branch**: `master` (protected)
- **Development**: Feature branches ‚Üí Pull Requests ‚Üí `master`
- **Releases**: Automated via semantic-release from `master`

### Team Structure

#### Maintainers (`@ngx-vest-forms/maintainers`)
- Full repository access
- Can merge PRs after review
- Manage releases and project direction
- Handle security issues and administrative tasks

#### Core Team (`@ngx-vest-forms/core-team`)
- Focus on library source code
- Required reviewers for core library changes
- Technical decision making for the library

#### Contributors (`@ngx-vest-forms/contributors`)
- Can review PRs for examples and documentation
- Trusted community members
- May be promoted to core team based on contributions

### Collaboration Models

#### For External Contributors (Recommended)
1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create feature branches** in your fork
3. **Submit Pull Requests** from your fork to our `master` branch
4. **Follow up** on review feedback

**Benefits:**
- Clean contribution history
- No direct access to main repository needed
- Standard open source workflow
- Easier permission management

#### For Project Collaborators
1. **Clone the main repository** directly
2. **Create feature branches** in the main repository
3. **Submit Pull Requests** to `master` branch
4. **Collaborate** directly within the repository

**Benefits:**
- Direct collaboration
- Easier for team members
- Faster iteration for trusted contributors

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Rules

### Master Branch Protection

The `master` branch is protected with the following rules:

#### Required Reviews
- **Minimum reviews**: 1 required
- **Code owner review**: Required (see `.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: Reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed
- **Require review from recent pushers**: The person who pushed most recent changes cannot approve

#### Status Checks
- **CI workflow must pass**: All automated tests and builds must succeed
- **Require branches to be up-to-date**: Branches must be current with `master`
- **Required checks**:
  - `ci` (GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Build and test completion
  - Storybook test completion

#### Protection Rules
- **Prevent force pushes**: Force pushes are blocked
- **Prevent deletion**: Branch cannot be deleted
- **Linear history**: Merge commits or squash merging required
- **No direct pushes**: All changes must go through Pull Requests

### Bypass Permissions

Repository administrators can bypass protection rules when necessary for:
- Emergency fixes
- Administrative changes
- Release process issues
