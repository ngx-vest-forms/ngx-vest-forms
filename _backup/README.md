# Backup Strategy for ngx-vest-forms Examples

## Current Status

This folder contains all example forms that have been temporarily moved out of the main application to allow for focused development on the fundamentals.

## Active Examples (Currently in main app)

- ✅ `01-fundamentals/minimal-form` - Working
- ✅ `01-fundamentals/basic-validation` - Working

## Backed Up Examples (In this folder)

### Fundamentals (from 01-fundamentals/)

- `field-states/` - Field state demonstration
- `form-state-demo/` - Form state API showcase

### Core Features (02-core-features/)

- Full folder moved to backup

### Control Wrapper (03-control-wrapper/)

- Full folder moved to backup

### Schema Integration (04-schema-integration/)

- Full folder moved to backup

### Smart State (05-smart-state/)

- Full folder moved to backup

### Advanced Patterns (06-advanced-patterns/)

- Full folder moved to backup

### Real World (06-real-world/)

## Progressive Restoration Plan

1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Get minimal-form and basic-validation working perfectly
2. **Phase 2**: Add back `field-states` and `form-state-demo` from fundamentals
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually restore examples from each category, modernizing as needed
4. **Phase 4**: Test and verify each example before moving to the next

## Restoration Process

When ready to restore an example:

1. Move the folder back to its original location
2. Update `app.routes.ts` to include the new route
3. Fix any compilation errors
4. Test the example thoroughly
5. Update this README

## Files Also Backed Up

- `app.routes.ts.original` - Original full routes file
- `app.routes.ts.backup` - Previous version before simplification

## Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ Clean development environment
- ✅ No distracting compilation errors
- ✅ Progressive complexity building
- ✅ Focused testing and verification
- ✅ Reference material preserved
- ✅ Easy to restore examples when ready
